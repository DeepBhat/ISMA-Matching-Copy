# ISMA Matching Algorithm
This program is a matching algorithm that calculates the score of every mentee and mentor and saves the highest score for each mentor

## Running the program
Make sure you have downloaded the excel data for mentees and mentors named *mentees.xlsx* and *mentors.xlsx* (included in the repository)!

Then use the terminal (anaconda prompt) to navigate to the repository and type
```bash
python main.py
```
The program should run without errors and create a new excel file *Scores.xlsx*

## Errors
If you run into errors, consider sending me a [mail](https://mail.google.com/mail/?to=deepbhatiaansh@gmail.com) or feel free to comment.
